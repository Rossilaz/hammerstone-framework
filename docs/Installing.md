# Installing
Hammerstone is a mod for Sapiens, just like any mod. Download the mods folder from the root of this project, and place it in `%appdata%/majicjungle/sapiens/mods/`. It should work without any issues, but if it doesn't, check [#Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Troubleshooting

### What's `%appdata`?
`%appdata%` is a path shortcut in Windows. It is resolved to `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming`. If it doesn't resolve for you, just use this path.
