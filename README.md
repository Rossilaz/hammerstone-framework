# Hammerstone Mod Framework

## About
This framework is a modding API for the upcoming Sapiens video game. It is (currently) heavily work-in-progress, so expect many breaking changes.

Hammerstone's purpose is to: 
* Clean abstraction layers
* Data-driven approaches to input handling, UI, etc
* Reusability and write-once architecture
